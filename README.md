##  Features :heavy_check_mark:
### (Positive Integers only )
Currently supports the following cool number properties:

- **[Perfect Square](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/perfect-squares/)** : An integer that is the square of another integer. ( -> 4, 9, 16, .. )
- **[Perfect Cube](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/perfect-cube/)** : An integer that is the cube of another integer. ( -> 8, 27, 64, .. )
- **[Palindrome](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PalindromicNumber.html)** : An number that reads the same when written backwards or forwards. ( -> 0-10, 11, 22, .. )
- **[Perfect](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PerfectNumber.html)** : An number which is the exact sum of it's factors(excluding itself). ( -> 6, 28, 496, .. )
- **[Fibonacci](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FibonacciNumber.html)** : Each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The sequence starts with 0, 1, ... ( -> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, .. )
- **[Tribonacci](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TribonacciNumber.html)** : Each number is the sum of the previous three numbers. The sequence starts with 0, 1, 1, ... ( -> 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, .. )
- **[Factorial](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Factorial.html)** : An integer that is the factorial of another integer (largest value program supports 479001600 -> 12!). ( -> 1, 2, 6, .. )
- **[Abundant](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/AbundantNumber.html)** : An number that is the greater than the sum of it's factors. ( -> 12, 18, 20, .. )
- **[Triangular](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangularNumber.html)** : An number that can be represented in the form of a triangular grid of points where the first row contains a single element and each subsequent row contains one more element than the previous one.  ( -> 1, 3, 6, .. )
- **[Sphenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number)** : An integer that is the product of exactly three distinct primes. ( -> 30, 42, 66, .. )
- **[Prime](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeNumber.html)** : An number that has only two factors-> 1 and itself. ( -> 2, 3, 5, .. )
- **[Mersenne Prime](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/MersennePrime.html)** : A prime that can be written as -> (2^n -1). ( -> 3, 5, 7, .. )
- **[Twin Prime](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TwinPrimes.html)** : Twin primes are pairs of primes of the form (p, p+2). ( -> (3, 5), (5, 7), (11, 13), .. )
- **[Kaprekar](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/KaprekarNumber.html)** : Consider an n-digit number k. Square it and add the right n digits to the left n or n-1 digits. If the resultant sum is k, then k is called a Kaprekar number.. ( -> 1, 9, 45, .. )
- **[Carol](https://oeis.org/A093112)** : A Carol number is an integer of the form 4n â€“ 2(n+1) â€“ 1. ( -> 7, 47, 223, .. )
- **[Pronic](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PronicNumber.html)** : A pronic number is a number that is the product of two consecutive integers. ( -> 2, 6, 12, .. )

###   In addition to the above, you can also:

- **[Prime factors](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/PrimeFactor.html)**: Return the factors and prime factors of a number.
- **[Collatz Conjecture](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html)**: List the number of steps required for a number to reach 1 in Collatz Conjecture.

#### Have fun!
